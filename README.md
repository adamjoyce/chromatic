# chromatic
Chromatic is a small block dodging game developed in Unity.

The aim is to dodge as many rows of blocks at possible by positioning the character in the gaps.  Watch out!  Some rows have no gaps and will require you to manipulate the background colour to match one of  block colours, creating a gap to pass through.

This is a prototype game idea that may be used to inform a more complete project in the future.

## Controls:

Move Left/Right - A/D

Change Background Colour - SPACE
